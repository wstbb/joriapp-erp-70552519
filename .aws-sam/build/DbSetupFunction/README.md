# This directory is intentionally created to isolate the assets for the DbSetupFunction.
# It should only contain files necessary for the database setup lambda, such as:
# - db_setup.py (the handler code)
# - seed.sql (the data seeding script)
# - requirements.txt (if any specific python packages are needed for this function)
